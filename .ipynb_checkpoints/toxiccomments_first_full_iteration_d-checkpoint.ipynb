No one yet has any clue as to what genes work to produce hair form and yet we here such facts, probably from the view point of some American or Western person who's most familiar dark skinned group are people with mostly recent West AFrican ancestry. And admixture with whom, themselves? As i've said we barely have an itch on the genes in the field (we may be getting closer) and i have friends who have no recent relatives with less curly or coily hair, all black skinned black people and the oldest son has almost curly hair, while the daughters don't. Also, the straight hair i see in the tropics is like that of most mammals that live in the heat, sort of rough looking, and not smooth and oily like that of Northern Eurasians, or like Penguin feathers or whatever it is on walrusses. The fact is that there are Mountains up and down East Africa (where we originate), in Northern Africa, and in West Africa, whose populations are usually less heavily pigmented than other groups (Ethiopia is familiar) possibly because of the angle of the UV rays (like elsewhere). It's unscientific to speak definitively on an issue all based on subjective posterings, ie, admixture. Further, the article isn't about admixture but what selective factors may be at play here. Unless you're aim is to tell people whose ancestors may have had nappy hair that they formerly had such, which would not be very possible at the moment let alone smooth. Again, who says the whole range has to originate from admixture instead of slow evolution of diversity (which decreases on its way to Eurasia, so you'd have to hypothesize on they instantly loose diversity in comparison with others, including Native American groups who weren't even there long enough to become depigmented.\n",

      "First of all the Kurdish flag is allowed in Iran, but is not sanctioned publicly. Kurds have it in their homes and are allowed to have them. It is certainly not criminal in Iran for Kurds to have the Kurdish flag or symbol as many of my friends do. So edit your statement about it being criminal in Iran. Need I remind you all, that Kurds are ethnic Iranians and have historically enjoyed the greatest liberties in Iran as opposed to the mainstream discrimination Kurds face in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey?  \n",
      "It is usually Israeli sources, with increasing American and British help and aid, that intentionally falsely claim that the Kurdish flag (which fly the Pan-Iranian colours as does the unofficial flag of the Azerbaijani people and the flag of Tajikistan) is prohibited in Iran. FLYING THE KURDISH FLAG IN IRAN IS NOT CRIMINAL AS MENTION IN ISRAELI SOURCES. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, I go on to read that there was research done that basically proves Kurds and Jews are genetically the same. It seems to me that certain individuals who I can see are Israeli are following the Israeli states policy of editing articles in lines with current events in the Middle East. Kurds are Iranians just as how Russians, Serbs, Poles, and Bulgarians are all Slavic peoples. Israel, the USA, and Britain are trying to create conflict in Iran as was done in the former Yugoslavia by creating problems along ethnic lines. This is called ‘balkanisation.’ The Israelis are doing this covertly through operations in Iraqi Kurdistan.\n",

      "Propaganda for dividing and conquering people starts with definitions then the manipulation of history. I am an academic in the fields of anthropology and history and an Iranian from a minority group that is neither Persian nor Kurdish.

I am alarmed by the current purging of internet articles that have hidden agendas trying to separate the Iranian identity of Kurds. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I was told by a Kurdish professor, Mr. Eskandari in Tehran: “Kurds are Iranian and the entity of Iran as a state and nation was founded by the [main] ancestors of the Kurds, the Mede who established Iran as an empire. One problem that has compounded the issue is that people misuse the term Persian and Iranian. Persians are Iranian, but all Iranians, like the Kurds and Ossetians, are not Persians.”\n",

There was a time when the Turkish government tried to convince Kurds that they were “Mountain Turks” and now there are powers at play that are either trying to disassociate the Kurds from their Iranian identity and origins or make whole generations of proud young Kurds forget or be unaware of their Iranian ethnicity. This is due to geo-strategic schemes. These forces are trying to victimize a whole group of people from knowing their own proud history and culture which is genuinely Iranian. The covert foreign policy of Israel, Britain, and America comes at the expense of the Kurds and even their history and culture.\n",

Agendas, goals, opinions are an essential part of man, and are the psychological foundation for information-aggregating projects like wikipedia. But you, not in control of your own emotions and psyche, and lacking any sort of moral-intellectual development, can only fixate upon your self-created enemy(I doubt timecop cares enough to make an enemy of any of you) and look for the slightest bit of mud to sling, the pitiful examples above.

If you want to explain a speedy keep close and his false accusations that I am trying to delete the article go for it. But this is more b.s. from you Drmies. I have no doubt that you are eager to block me. I've been a witness to various abuses by you including the extent to which you will go to enforce you personal POV on article content. That's why I try to avoid you but you chose to involve yourself in the Hawaii drama. As far as personal attacks, shove em. You and your buddy hasfajen have been launching jibes at me for a long time and I've put up with them. So take your own medicine. You want to clean up the personal attacks? Start with your buddies and their disruption and unprovoked personal attacks on me. You've been warned.    \"\n",

      "Hilarious how Wikipedia purports to have a NPOV policy yet articles such as this continue to show just how liberal-biased its editors actually are. To wit, the first paragraph is an absolute joke. It might as well be a full-scale endorsement of modern liberalism. Focus on “individual liberties” so long as they don’t intrude upon the liberties and rights of others? That’s actually libertarianism (about as far right as you can get). How about modern liberals favor bigger government, higher taxes, and redistribution of wealth? No, that would be telling the truth, and wikipedians hate the truth if it places their ideology in a bad light. No matter what sources you bring to the table, and no matter how many you bring to the table, the masses of welfare-loving, big-government-favoring, anti-American, anti-religious, pro-terrorist, socialist democrat monkeys who run this mickey-mouse operation will (1) find a problem with the source (even when it is a peer-reviewed journal), (2) claim other sources favor the opposing viewpoint (even when their sources come from unreliable, and HIGHLTY biased sources), or – and this is the most common response – (3) try and interpret your source in a manner that would make it consistent with their own views (in vain, but since consensus carries the day, they end up winning).

First of all, I am not arguing over the number of each ethnic group but instead you are. I never changed the numbers, rather I changed and replaced the old 1980, hard to read and understand map of yours. My map, the one above, explains little more about each Ethnic group, while yours does not. Demographics of Afghanistan should not just be the numbers of each group but also include a brief explanation about who or what these people are and or where they originate from. By watching your actions and you keep insisting that your map remains in Afghanistan's article, there must be something you are up to. Also something I noticed, you keep talking about the numbers of Pashtuns should be lower, which indicates that you wish to see them die or something. I will slowly look around for an administrator to help with removing and deleting your silly outdated man soon. I wish not to bother talking or discussing anything with you as I find that you are not a nice person to talk or socialize with. You keep reminding that Pashtuns killed this Pashtuns killed that, why don't you discuss about Pashtuns always being killed by invaders. They have the right to rule their country and they have the right to kill anyone they find as a traitor to their country. This law is practiced in all the countries of the world. By now I've already realized that you are not just a traitor to Afghanistan but also a true enemy of Pashtuns. I have Allah (Almighty God) on my side and that's why I always win.\n",

If you think it's OK for them to have it heard by default, by them crying to admins when they're called out on it, then you're just enabling the inevitable outcome, total derision of the idea Wikipedia is an encyclopedia at all. This is not consensus, this is rules of the playground.\n",
